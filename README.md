# Highway Car Sharing API
This project, developed in 2023, is a C application that simulates a car-sharing system along a highway. The highway features multiple service areas, each with a fleet of electric cars with varying ranges. The system provides robust functionality for managing service stations and vehicles, with a core algorithm to find the most efficient travel routes, while respecting the memory usage and calculation speed requirements.

## Key Features

### Service Station Management  
- **Add a service station:** Insert a new station at a specific point on the highway.  
- **Remove a service station:** Delete an existing station and update the system accordingly.  

### Electric Vehicle Management  
- **Add a vehicle:** Add a new electric car to a specified service station with its range.  
- **Remove a vehicle:** Remove a vehicle from a designated service station.  

### Optimal Route Search: `pathfinder`  
The primary function of the system. It finds the best route between two stations, considering their positions along the highway.  
- Supports searching from a closer station to a farther one and vice versa.
- Optimizes the path with the least number of service stations passed.  
- Optimizes the path to pass through stations nearest to the highway's starting point (distance 0).
